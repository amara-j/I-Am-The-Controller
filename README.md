Artists' statement: By superimposing the human face (what the computer might "see" from its perspective) with randomly colored squares showing where the computer has detected movement, we aim to make visible both sides of a conversation between human and computer. We have intentionally pixelated the viewer's self-image in an attempt to anonymize them, as a way to subvert the underlying context of digital surveillance and facial recognition as widespread tools of oppression and violence. As the user continues to interact with the instrument, they might begin to feel as though the air has substance, or that they are touching or playing the negative space around them. We hope that this experience heightens sensory awareness and demonstrates the radical positive potential of often-abused technologies.
